Classical methods of option pricing (for example, the Black-Scholes model) have a number of limitations 
(for example, the inability to add additional features, or unrealistic assumptions). 
Therefore, we propose an alternative approach - the construction of additional features, 
and the use of Machine Learning methods and neural networks. 
Accordingly, scripts and materials on this topic will be published in this repository.  
The materials were prepared within the framework of my Bachelor Thesis and are accessible and open.
